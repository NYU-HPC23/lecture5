// Synopsis
// The order of memory operations may not be the same as that of the program
// order. On a single thread the reordering respects sequential consistency i.e.
// the re-ordering will not change the final result. But when using multiple
// threads, the sequence of memory operation observed from another thread may be
// different than the program order.
//
// Weak sequential consistency
// - Memory operations are not ordered with respect to each other; i.e. memory
// operations may be re-ordered as long as it does not change the observed order
// on the same thread.
// - Memory operations are ordered with respect to synchronization operations
// such as barrier and flush
//
